Installation
============

Ziwia is being developed with ``requests >= 2.14.2`` as only requirement. It uses just small set of its functionality
and thus should work even with older versions of requests.

.. code-block:: python

    pip install requests

If you install ziwia from PyPi, all requirements should be installed with just one line:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install ziwia

Or you may close github repository and install ziwia locally:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/malja/ziwia.git

That is all. See :ref:`basic_usage` for basic examples of usage.
